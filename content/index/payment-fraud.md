  - subheader: Stop chargebacks in their tracks
    markdownContent: Any form of payment fraud can result in a chargeback for your website,
      which may result in lost revenue, stolen goods or services, and damage to
      your merchant reputation. No matter the cause, accurate user
      identification helps reduce this incredibly important indicator of
      fraudulent activity by authenticating or stopping at-risk purchases before
      they occur.
