      title: Increase revenue for your business
      content: Account sharers already know the value of your service. By enforcing
        subscription limits via user identification, you can convert "free"
        account-sharing users to paying customers without negatively impacting
        the rest of your users' experience.

      title: Increase security for your customers
      content: Password sharing increases the likelihood of account takeover, and
        makes it more difficult for your team to identify real risks. By
        ensuring customers keep their accounts to themselves, you can improve
        account security for all users.
