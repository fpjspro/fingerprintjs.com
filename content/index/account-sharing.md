  - subheader: Catch account sharers where other tracking methods fail
    markdown__Content: >-
      Mobile devices, infrequent logins, and privacy browsing make detecting
      account sharing difficult. An account can be misidentified as having
      multiple owners if their browsing behavior changes over time. Conversely,
      visitors can appear the same if not enough unique information is
      collected.


      FingerprintJS overcomes these technical challenges by using state-of-the-art browser identification and machine learning techniques.


      **To generate unique visitorIDs,** FingerprintJS uses browser fingerprinting, cookies, and other technologies including server-side detection techniques. By combining many identification methods, FingerprintJS can reach a higher level of accuracy than any other solution.


      **To ensure visitorIDs are stable over time,** FingerprintJS uses fuzzy matching and other deduplication techniques. FingerprintJS Pro associates new browsing history with the correct visitorID even if some details about the visitor have changed.
