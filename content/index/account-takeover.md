      title: Credential Stuffing Prevention
      markdown__Content: Users that re-use passwords across multiple services are at
        risk of having their accounts accessed by fraudsters who purchased or
        hacked their account information from elsewhere. These fraudsters may
        then test thousands of login credentials on your site to gain access.
        Stop the threat by associating multiple login attempts from bot networks
        and preventing additional attempts from related visitorIDs using
        FingerprintJS Pro.

      title: Phishing Attack Prevention
      markdown__Content: Social engineering is among the most reliable methods for
        fraudsters to access accounts of your trusted customers. Phishing
        techniques can also be notoriously difficult to prevent. Websites can
        stop phishing fraud with FingerprintJS Pro's accurate visitor
        identification by requiring new and untrusted visitors to provide
        additional authentication before accessing their accounts.

      conjunction with existing authentication workflows, using our API and
