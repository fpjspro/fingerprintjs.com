  - subheader: Powerful fingerprinting prevents gaming fraud
    markdown__Content: Cheating in online gaming can ruin the fun for your ethical
      players, and can be notoriously difficult to stop.   Prevent fraud at its
      source by creating a unique ID for your visitors, associating their
      activity across visits, incognito mode, and other cloaking methods. By
      understanding your visitors' browsing behavior, you can identify common
      patterns of fraud and require additional authentication as needed.
