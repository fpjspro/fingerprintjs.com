    content: Cheating in online gaming can ruin the fun for your good players, and
      can be notoriously difficult to stop.   Prevent fraud at its source by
      creating a unique ID for your visitors, associating their activity across
      browsers, incognito mode and other cloaking methods. By understanding your
      visitors' browsing behavior, you can identify common patterns of fraud and
      require additional authentication as needed.
