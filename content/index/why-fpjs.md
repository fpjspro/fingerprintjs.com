      title: Unparalleled accuracy
      markdownContent: Address fraudulent behavior at the source rather than through complex
        mitigation strategies later with a highly accurate visitorID.
        FingerprintJS uses an innovative combination of  browser fingerprinting,
        IP/URL analysis, device analysis, and machine learning to accurately
        identify up to 99.5% of unique visitors.

      title: Targeted authentication
      markdownContent: Introducing unnecessary hurdles to account login and payment can be
        detrimental to user experience. Using our API, you can identify when you
        need to introduce additional authentication, keeping your trusted
        customers' experience streamlined.
    - title: GDPR and CCPA compliant
      markdownContent: We take online privacy seriously. FingerprintJS is intended for fraud
        detection only - for this use case, no visitor consent is required for
        compliancy with GDPR and CGPA. We never automatically track traffic, and
        never do cross-domain tracking.

    - title: Committed to open source
      markdownContent: Our team is committed to democratizing fraud prevention by keeping our
        core fingerprinting libraries open-source and free.

  - subheader: The power of fingerprinting
    markdownContent: "Fingerprinting technology is the backbone of most major fraud
      detection solutions. Fingerprinting identifies unique visitors and
      associated sessions, undeterred by incognito browsing, VPNs, cookie
      blockers, and other technologies used to anonymize fraudulent actors
      online.  The technology works by analyzing data passed by the visitor's
      browser, device, patterns of use, and more to generate a unique visitorID
      that can associate patterns of fraud with specific visitors. "
