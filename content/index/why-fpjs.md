  - subheader: The Power of Fingerprinting
    content: "Fingerprinting technology is the backbone of most major fraud
      detection solutions. Fingerprinting can identify unique visitors and
      associate sessions through incognito browsing, VPNs, cookie blockers and
      other technologies used to anonymize fraudulent actors online.  The
      technology works by analyzing data passed by the visitor's browser,
      device, patterns of use and more to generate a unique visitorID, which can
      be used to associate patterns of fraud with specific visitors. "
