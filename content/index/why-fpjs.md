        can be detrimental to user experience. Using our API, you can isolate
        malicious actors across browsing sessions, keeping your trusted
        customers' experience streamlined.
    - title: GDPR and CCPA compliant
      markdown__Content: We take online privacy seriously. FingerprintJS is intended
        for fraud detection only - for this use case, no visitor consent is
        required for compliancy with GDPR and CCPA. We never automatically track
        traffic, and never do cross-domain tracking.

  - subheader: The power of fingerprinting
    markdown__Content: "Fingerprinting technology is the backbone of most major
      fraud detection solutions. Fingerprinting identifies unique visitors and
      associated sessions, undeterred by incognito browsing, VPNs, cookie
      blockers, and other technologies used to anonymize fraudulent actors
      online.  The technology works by analyzing data passed by the visitor's
      browser, device, patterns of use, and more to generate a unique visitorID
      that can associate patterns of fraud with specific visitors. "
